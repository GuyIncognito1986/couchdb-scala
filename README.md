# couchdb-scala

This is a Scala library providing a purely functional client for
[CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/). The design goals are compositionality,
expressiveness, and type-safety.

It's based on the following awesome libraries:
[Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz),
[Http4s](https://github.com/http4s/http4s),
[uPickle](https://github.com/lihaoyi/upickle),
[Monocle](https://github.com/julien-truffaut/Monocle), and others.

Here is a basic example of an application that stores a set of case class
instances in a database, retrieves them back, and prints out afterwards:

```Scala
object Basic extends App {

  // Define a simple case class to represent our data model
  case class Person(name: String, age: Int)

  // Define a type mapping used to transform class names into the doc kind
  val \/-(typeMapping) = TypeMapping(classOf[Person] -> "Person")

  // Define some sample data
  val alice = Person("Alice", 25)
  val bob   = Person("Bob", 30)
  val carl  = Person("Carl", 20)

  // Create a CouchDB client instance
  val couch  = CouchDb("127.0.0.1", 5984)
  // Define a database name
  val dbName = "couchdb-scala-basic-example"
  // Get an instance of the DB API by name and type mapping
  val db     = couch.db(dbName, typeMapping)

  val actions = for {
    // Delete the database or ignore the error if it doesn't exist
    _ <- couch.dbs.delete(dbName).or(Task.now(Res.Ok()))
    // Create a new database
    _ <- couch.dbs.create(dbName)
    // Insert documents into the database
    _ <- db.docs.createMany(Seq(alice, bob, carl))
    // Retrieve all documents from the database and unserialize to Person
    docs <- db.docs.getMany.queryIncludeDocs[Person]
  } yield docs.getDocsData

  // Execute the actions and process the result
  actions.attemptRun match {
    // In case of an error (left side of Either), print it
    case -\/(e) => println(e)
    // In case of a success (right side of Either), print each object
    case \/-(a) => a.map(println(_))
  }

}
```
